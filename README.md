# encoder
Encrypt your message with 3 different engines: Caesar, Reverse, and Symbol.

Caesar:  Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
Example: ABC to BCD

Reverse: Reverse order of your message.
Example: Hello to Olleh

Symbol: Turn letters to symbol with similar looks.
Example: $i to s!

##messageMixer.js
Let the user choose from 3 different encoders. If the encoder is caesar, another input is needed for number of positions being offset.

##superEncoder.js
Encrypt and decrypt your secret message with combinations of encoders. Hint: you can use it to create your super password no one can guess.
